A physical property measured by an imaging device and presented as a picture must meet the following three conditions:
1. It has to penetrate the human body
2. It mustn't excessively interfere with the human body
3. It must be meaningful for medical analysis 

Four major and several minor imaging techniques meet the requirements above:

- X-ray imaging: measures the absorption of short-wave electromagnetic waves
- Magnetic resonance imaging: measures densiy and molecular binding of selected atoms (most notable is hydrogen)
- Ultrasound imaging: collects reflections at boundaries between and within tissues with different acoustic impedance
- Nuclear imaging: measures the distribution of radioactive tracer material administered through the blood flow (used for functional imaging)

Other imaging techniques:
- EEG and MEG imaging
- optical and electron microscopy
- optical coherence tomography
- photography

Many imaging techniques come in 2 varieties:
- Projection images: depict the projection of the 3d human body onto a 2d plane
- Slice images: can be stacked to form a 3D volume

Digitized images consist of a finite number of image elements (can be refered to scene elements if the dimension is not known or not important):
- 2D picture elements-pixels (+/- time)
- 3D or stacked picture elements-voxels (+/- time)
