## Characteristics
- Electromagnetic waves with wavelengths below the visible spectrum (frequency above)
- Has wave characteristics but travels as clusters of energy or photons with a given wavelength
- Do not need a carrier
- Travel at the speed of light

The wavelength Î» and frequency f are related by:

The energy of a photon measured in eV is the energy that a single electron acquires when moving through a potential of 1 V. The energy of a photon is characterized by its wavelength and is given by:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=e=\frac{1.24}{\lambda}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?e=\frac{1.24}{\lambda}" title="e=\frac{1.24}{\lambda}" /></a>

where the unit of measurement is keV and the wavelength is expressed in nm.

The wavelength of an electromagnetic wave corresponds to its energy. If ordered by increasing energy, electromagnetic waves can be:

- radio waves (used for MRI)
- visible light
- X-rays or gamma (created in the nucleus) rays

The energy of the X-ray photons is enough to release electrons from an atom - process of ionizing radiation. 

**Exposure**-amount of charge per volume of air, measured in Roentgen (R) characterizes the X-rays. 
- measures the energy of the radiation source
- does not describe how much radiation is absorbed by the body under the radiation

**Dose**-absorption per unit mass, measured in radiation absorbed dose (rad) or gray (Gy) with 1 Gy=100 rad

**f-factor**-ratio between the dose and the exposure, varies with the X-ray energy
- much higher for hard tissues at low exposure (bones) compared to soft tissue and water
- thus, bone at low doses absorbs a significantly higher amount of radiation than soft tissue

## X-ray Generation
- electrons in an atom organized in shells around the nucleus
- the innermost shell contains electrons with the lowest energy
- energy is needed to move an electron from an inner shell to an outer shell - this is the difference between energy levels of the two shells 
- for the electron to be released from a shell, an energy amounting to the difference between its current energy level and the level of the outermost shell is needed, in additon to the energy needed to remove the electron from the outermost shell (these are easiest to remove and are called valence electrons)

X-rays are the result of the excess energy from electrons in the material of a cathode ray tube (CRT) when the cathode is heated up. (The material is usually tungsten). 
Energy from heating causes the electrons to be released from the cathode and accelerated towards the anode. 
In the anode, electrons lose their kinetic energy by:
- excitation - causes electrons of the anode material to move from an outer shell to an inner shell, happens directly
- ionization - causes electrons of the anode material to move from an outer shell to an inner shell by exciting the electrons of another atom
- radiation - excess energy released as X-rays (depends on the energy difference between the outer and inner shell), monochrome/characteristic radiation

However, most generated X-ray radiation is polychrome. 
- an incident electron slows down when passing the nucleus of an atom and its path is deflected
- this changes the frequency of the electron, whereby the excess energy is emitted as photon
- the amount of emitted photons depends on how close the electron passes the nucleus
- energy lost is emitted as a bremsstrahlung X-ray photon
- approximately 80% of the population of X-rays within the X-ray beam consists of X-rays generated in this way

## X-ray Spectrum

- As a result of characteristic and bremsstrahlung radiation generation a spectrum of X-ray energy is produced within the X-ray beam
- The spectrum of the bremsstrahlung of a cathode ray tube should be roughly of a triangular shape
- Because the sorrounding glass of the tube filters some of the low energy radiation, the actual curve is zero at low energy, increases to a maximum at some intermediate energy level and decreases to zero at the maximum energy
- The complete spectrum is a combination of monochrome and polychrome radiation
- Spikes indicate some characteristic radiation energy levels
