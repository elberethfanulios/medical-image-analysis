## Characteristics
- Electromagnetic waves with wavelengths over the visible spectrum
- Has wave characteristics but travels as clusters of energy or photons with a given wavelength
- Do not need a carrier
- Travel at the speed of sound

The wavelength Î» and frequency f are related by:

The energy of a photon measured in eV is the energy that a single electron acquires when moving through a potential of 1 V. The energy of a photon is characterized by its wavelength and is given by:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=e=\frac{1.24}{\lambda}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?e=\frac{1.24}{\lambda}" title="e=\frac{1.24}{\lambda}" /></a>

where the unit of measurement is keV and the wavelength is expressed in nm.

The wavelength of an electromagnetic wave corresponds to its energy. If ordered by increasing energy, electromagnetic waves can be:

- radio waves (used for MRI)
- visible light
- X-rays or gamma (created in the nucleus) rays

The energy of the X-ray photons is enough to release electrons from an atom - process of ionizing radiation. 

**Exposure**-amount of charge per volume of air, measured in Roentgen (R) characterizes the X-rays. 
- measures the energy of the radiation source
- does not describe how much radiation is absorbed by the body under the radiation

**Dose**-absorption per unit mass, measured in radiation absorbed dose (rad) or gray (Gy) with 1 Gy=100 rad

**f-factor**-ratio between the exposure and the dose, varies with the X-ray energy
- much higher for hard tissues at low exposure (bones) compared to soft tissue and water
- thus, bone at low doses absorbs a significantly higher amount of radiation than soft tissue
